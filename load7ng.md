# 👋 Hey, I'm load7ng

I build tools that make computers (and my brain) behave better.

Currently focused on:
- 🧠 Personal "Second Brain" system (local search + memory logging)
- 🐍 Python tooling & automation
- 🛠 Linux systems, debugging, and performance analysis
- 🔐 Cybersecurity fundamentals & system behavior

I like understanding **why** systems behave the way they do — not just how to click through them.

## 🧠 Interests

- System behavior & debugging
- Security mindset
- Automation
- Human psychology & productivity systems
- Music (drums, guitar, piano)

I like projects that sit between:
> engineering × curiosity × self-optimization

---

## 🎯 Current Focus

Turning small tools into:
- reliable
- usable
- actually part of my daily workflow

Less "tutorial projects"  
More "I use this every day"

---

## 📫 Philosophy

I’m not trying to build the next startup every week.

I build:
- tools I actually need  
- systems I can understand deeply  
- things that reduce chaos

⭐ If you like system-level tools, personal knowledge systems, or weird productivity engineering — we’ll get along.
